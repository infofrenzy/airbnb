# Airbnb: Distribution of Prices and Bookings Across Different Neighborhood

# **Project mission:**

The project mission is to analyze the Airbnb Stockholm data to provide insights into the distribution of listing prices across different neighborhoods and the occupancy rates of those neighborhoods. This research has been initiated by the Airbnb management and operations team in Stockholm who have identified a need to optimize the occupancy rates and profitability of Airbnb listings in the city. They have observed that while some neighborhoods have high occupancy rates, others are struggling to attract guests. This is a significant problem as it not only affects the profitability of the individual property owners but also the overall reputation of Airbnb as a platform for tourists visiting Stockholm.

The two main objectives of the project are:

1. To compare and analyze the distribution of listing prices across different neighborhoods in Stockholm to identify which neighborhoods have the highest and lowest prices.
2. To identify which neighborhood has a higher occupancy rate and analyze the factors contributing to it. By achieving these objectives, the project can provide valuable insights to the stakeholders on how to optimize their Airbnb listings to maximize their profitability and occupancy rates.

The results of the analysis will be used to develop recommendations for property owners and the Airbnb management team to improve the occupancy rates and profitability of their Airbnb listings. This will also benefit tourists visiting Stockholm by providing them with a wider range of quality and affordable Airbnb accommodations across different neighborhoods.
